# CableForge Development Roadmap

## Project Status: Planning Complete ✅

All planning and documentation has been completed. The project is ready for implementation following Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles.

## Completed Planning Tasks

### ✅ Documentation
- **REQUIREMENTS.md** - Complete functional and technical requirements based on Q&A
- **TECHNICAL_SPEC.md** - Architecture, database schema, and implementation details  
- **USER_STORIES.md** - Detailed user stories with acceptance criteria
- **UI_MOCKUPS.md** - Visual mockups for all main application views

### ✅ Project Structure
- Organized folder structure for React/TypeScript frontend and Rust/Tauri backend
- Separate directories for tests, documentation, and mockups
- Clear separation of concerns

### ✅ Test-Driven Development Setup
- **Unit tests** - Calculations, validation, database operations
- **Integration tests** - File operations, state management, API communication  
- **End-to-end tests** - Complete user workflows
- **Test configuration** - Vitest for unit/integration, Playwright for E2E
- **Test utilities** - Mocks, fixtures, and helper functions

## Ready for Implementation

### Phase 1: Foundation (Ready to Start)
With all planning complete, development can begin with:

1. **Project initialization**
   ```bash
   npm create tauri-app cableforge --template react-ts
   cd cableforge
   npm install
   ```

2. **First TDD cycle**
   - Write failing tests for basic cable CRUD operations
   - Implement minimal code to pass tests
   - Refactor and improve

3. **Database setup**
   - Implement SQLite schema from technical spec
   - Create database migration system
   - Test project file creation/loading

### Implementation Order (TDD Approach)

#### Week 1-2: Core Foundation
- [ ] Set up Tauri + React + TypeScript project
- [ ] Implement basic database operations (TDD)
- [ ] Create project file management (TDD)
- [ ] Build basic UI layout and navigation

#### Week 3-4: Cable Management  
- [ ] Cable CRUD operations (TDD)
- [ ] Cable table with inline editing
- [ ] Auto-numbering system (TDD)
- [ ] Basic validation (TDD)

#### Week 5-6: I/O Management
- [ ] I/O point CRUD operations (TDD)
- [ ] PLC assignment logic (TDD)
- [ ] Cable-to-I/O linking (TDD)
- [ ] Conflict detection (TDD)

#### Week 7-8: Conduit & Routing
- [ ] Conduit management (TDD)
- [ ] Cable routing assignment
- [ ] Fill calculations (TDD)
- [ ] Routing validation (TDD)

#### Week 9-10: Engineering Calculations
- [ ] Voltage drop calculator (TDD)
- [ ] Conduit fill calculator (TDD)
- [ ] Segregation validator (TDD)
- [ ] Real-time calculation updates

#### Week 11-12: Advanced Features
- [ ] Library system (TDD)
- [ ] Import/Export functionality (TDD)
- [ ] Revision management (TDD)
- [ ] Template builder

## Key Success Factors

### 1. Maintain TDD Discipline
- Always write tests first
- Keep tests simple and focused
- Refactor regularly for code quality
- Maintain high test coverage (>90%)

### 2. Follow Requirements Strictly  
- Implement only what's documented
- Resist feature creep
- Focus on core functionality first
- Get user feedback early and often

### 3. Incremental Development
- Complete one feature fully before starting next
- Deliver working software regularly
- Test with real data frequently
- Keep deployable main branch

### 4. Code Quality Standards
- TypeScript strict mode
- ESLint/Prettier formatting
- Clear naming conventions
- Comprehensive documentation

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Database performance** - Test with large datasets early
- **Tauri limitations** - Validate complex file operations
- **UI responsiveness** - Use virtual scrolling for large tables
- **Cross-platform compatibility** - Test on multiple OS regularly

### Project Risks
- **Scope creep** - Stick to documented requirements
- **Over-engineering** - Focus on simplicity
- **Testing overhead** - Maintain TDD discipline but be pragmatic
- **User feedback** - Get early prototypes to engineers for validation

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Success Criteria
- [ ] Can create and save project files
- [ ] Can add/edit/delete cables
- [ ] Basic calculations work correctly
- [ ] Tests pass and maintain >90% coverage
- [ ] Application runs on Windows

### Final Success Criteria  
- [ ] Handles 1000+ cables smoothly
- [ ] Generates professional Excel reports
- [ ] Engineers can complete typical workflows efficiently
- [ ] No data loss or corruption
- [ ] Passes all acceptance tests

## Next Steps

1. **Initialize project** - Set up Tauri app with dependencies
2. **Write first test** - Simple cable creation test
3. **Implement minimal code** - Make test pass
4. **Continue TDD cycle** - Build incrementally
5. **Regular check-ins** - Review progress against roadmap

The project is now fully planned and ready for implementation. The comprehensive documentation ensures all stakeholders understand the requirements, architecture, and approach. Following the TDD methodology will ensure high code quality and reduce bugs while building exactly what's needed.
